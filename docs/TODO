%GENERAL%
%%%%%%%%%
Add iterators instead of for cycles

Object FUNCTION to pas the function and eventually the derivative
	(instead of pointers to function): more complex for the user as
	he must specify a class


%%%%%%%%
%SOLVER%
%%%%%%%%
Solver robustness: check the given interval Solver: virtual
	destructor in case of derivation
	
Solver and Implicit solver differs only for the type of integrator. They can consequently be merged if a pure virtual class Integrator is created
