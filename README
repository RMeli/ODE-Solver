# NOLNLIEAR FIRST ORDER ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS #
#########################################################

This library allows to solve nonlinear first order ordinary differential equations. Three one step explicit methods and three implicit methods are provided.

%%%%%%%%%%%
% COMPILE %
%%%%%%%%%%%
In order to compile the library we have to type
	
	./compile
	
This command call the CMake utility that creates a Makefile, that is then used directly to compile the whole library.

An extensive testsuite is provided and the binary files for all the test are found in 

	build/Tests
	
Note that CMake reproduce the same tree that we find in the /src directory.

% USE %
%%%%%%%
Provided tests:
TEST_Solver and TEST_AnalyticalSolver solve a given problem with all the provided integrators, both implicit and explicit (note that eventual exceptions thrown by the integrators when trying to solve the problem are not handled!). The function defining the problem is defined in scr/Tests/testfunction.h It is sufficient to modify this file and recompile in order to specify a new problem.

Personal use:
Create a new .cpp file containing the main function in /scr/Tests and add it (with the needed dependencies) on the CMakeLists.txt file on the same folder, following what is done with the testsuite. It is also possible to create a new folder (that need a new CMakeLists.txt) containing the new files. Remember that relative path must be specified for the inclusions.

% DOC %

In order to create the documentation we have to type
	
	./document
	
Documentation contain the GPL license (docs/license), a detailed description of the project (docs/description) with possible extensions and limitations and Doxygen documentation (docs/doxygen).
