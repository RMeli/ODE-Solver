# NOLNLIEAR FIRST ORDER ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS #
#########################################################

This library allows to solve nonlinear first order ordinary differential equations. Three one step explicit methods and three implicit methods are provided.

% COMPILE %
%%%%%%%%%%%
In order to compile the library we have to type
	
	./compile
	
This command call the CMake program that creates a Makefile, that is then used directly to compile the whole library.

An extensive testsuite is provided and the binary files for all the test are found in src/Tests.

%%%%%%%
% USE %
%%%%%%%
Provided tests:
TEST_Solver and TEST_AnalyticalSolver solve a given problem with all the provided integrators, both implicit and explicit (note that eventual exceptions thrown by the integrators when trying to solve the problem are not handled!). The function defining the problem is defined in scr/Tests/testfunction.h It is sufficient to modify this file and recompile in order to specify a new problem.

Personal use:
